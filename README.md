================================================================
Amirsaman Nov. 2017


I will be dividing this series of tutorials into five parts:

    Part 1: Booting Up R
    Part 2: The Gender-Class Model
    Part 3: Decision Trees
    Part 4: Feature Engineering
    Part 5: Random Forests


If you have any questions about these lessons, Iâ€™d encourage you to post them to the Kaggle forums:

where many others may have already come across the issue before and can jump in to help you out.
